## Course Description in detail

Flask's popularity continues to grow across the web development, software engineering, and data science communities, due to its simplicity and flexibility. In this course, software engineer Natasha Ferguson equips you with the skills to build lightweight web applications using Flask, and meet the current demand for quick, scalable web solutions. Explore Flask as you step through the development of a Health Tracker Dashboard. Learn about Flaskâ€™s core features, including routes, templating, form handling, database integration, and data visualization, and how to deploy an application.

The value of building a Health Tracker Dashboard is in empowering you to actively engage with and understand your daily health routines. By inputting data on exercise, meals, and sleep, you can visualize your habits through charts and graphs, which makes it easier to identify patterns and areas for improvement.
